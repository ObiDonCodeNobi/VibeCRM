# VibeCRM Domain Layer

This directory contains the domain layer of VibeCRM, which is responsible for representing the core business logic and domain entities. It follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure a rich and expressive model.

## Directory Structure

### Entities

Contains the core domain entities that represent the business model. These entities encapsulate the business logic and rules.

### Value Objects

Defines value objects used within the domain. Value objects are immutable and distinguishable only by their properties.

### Aggregates

Defines aggregate roots and their boundaries. Aggregates ensure consistency within their boundaries and enforce invariants.

### Repositories

Defines repository interfaces for accessing and persisting aggregate roots. These interfaces are implemented in the infrastructure layer.

### Specifications

Contains specification classes that encapsulate complex query logic and business rules. Specifications are used to query repositories.

## Implementation Details

### Domain-Driven Design

The domain layer adheres to DDD principles, focusing on the core business logic and rules. It ensures that the model remains consistent and expressive, encapsulating the business's true nature.

### Separation of Concerns

The domain layer is independent of other layers, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. It does not depend on infrastructure or application layers, allowing for flexibility and testability.

### Rich Domain Model

The domain layer embraces a rich domain model, where entities and value objects contain behavior and logic, not just data. This approach leads to a more maintainable and understandable codebase.
