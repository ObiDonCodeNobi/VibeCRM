# Repository Standards

## Overview
This document details the repository implementation.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Three-Layer Repository Pattern
- **Domain Layer**: Contains interfaces defining core operations. These are organized into `Business`, `Junction`, and `TypeStatus` directories.
- **Application Layer**: No interfaces currently exist in the `Application\Common\Interfaces\Repositories` directory, indicating a potential area for development.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains concrete implementations of the repositories, organized similarly to the Domain Layer.

### 2. File Organization
```
VibeCRM/
├── Domain/
│   └── Interfaces/
│       └── Repositories/
│           ├── Business/
│           ├── Junction/
│           └── TypeStatus/
├── Infrastructure/
│   └── Persistence/
│       └── Repositories/
│           ├── Business/
│           ├── Junction/
│           └── TypeStatus/
├── Application/
│   └── Common/
│       └── Interfaces/
│           └── Repositories/
```

## Observations
- **Domain Layer**: Well-structured with clear separation into different repository categories.
- **Application Layer**: Lacks repository interfaces, which may be necessary for application-specific operations and DTO returns.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Aligns with the Domain Layer structure, providing concrete implementations.

## Recommendations
1. **Develop Application Layer Interfaces**: Implement interfaces in the Application Layer to bridge domain operations with application-specific needs.
2. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistency in naming and structure across all layers to align with the three-layer repository pattern.
3. **Document Interfaces**: Ensure all interfaces and methods have comprehensive XML documentation to aid maintainability and understanding.

## Conclusion
The current repository structure in VibeCRM follows the outlined standards but requires enhancements in the Application Layer to fully leverage the three-layer pattern.

### Detailed Recommendations for Application Layer Enhancements
1. **Introduction of Application-Specific Interfaces**:
   - Develop interfaces that extend domain repository interfaces to include application-specific operations.
   - Ensure these interfaces return DTOs instead of domain entities to maintain separation of concerns and adhere to the CQRS pattern.

2. **Support for Advanced Features**:
   - Implement support for pagination, filtering, and sorting in application-specific interfaces to enhance query capabilities.
   - Utilize these features to improve performance and user experience in data retrieval operations.

3. **Integration with MediatR**:
   - Leverage MediatR for handling command and query operations within the Application Layer.
   - This integration will provide a clean separation of concerns and facilitate the implementation of the CQRS pattern.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Ensure all new interfaces and methods are thoroughly documented with XML comments.
   - This documentation should include method summaries, parameter descriptions, return types, and example usage where applicable.
