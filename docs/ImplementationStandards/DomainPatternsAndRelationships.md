# Domain Patterns and Relationships

## Primary Domain Patterns

### 1. Base Entity Pattern
The `BaseEntity` class serves as the foundation for all domain entities, providing:
- Unique identification via UUID/GUID
- Audit tracking (creation/modification)
- Soft delete capability
- Domain consistency

### 2. Common Behavioral Interfaces
Key interfaces that define standard entity behaviors:
- `IHasActivities<T>`: Entities that can have associated activities
- `IHasAttachments<T>`: Entities that can have attachments
- `IHasCalls<T>`: Entities that can have call records
- `IHasEmailAddresses<T>`: Entities that can have email addresses
- `IHasNotes<T>`: Entities that can have notes
- `IHasPhones<T>`: Entities that can have phone numbers
- `IHasQuotes<T>`: Entities that can have quotes
- `IHasSalesOrders<T>`: Entities that can have sales orders

### 3. Entity Relationships

## Person Domain

### Domain Entity Structure
The Person domain is implemented as a rich domain model with the following key characteristics:

1. **Person Entity**
   - Core identity information (First, Middle, Last name)
   - Basic contact details (Email, Phone)
